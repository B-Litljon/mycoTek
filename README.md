# mycoTek

## Overview

mycoTek is a passion project born from my love for mycology and desire to create a modern, secure, and engaging platform for the mycology community. As a hobby mycologist who has been growing and learning about mushrooms for a long time, I found myself unable to continue cultivating due to my current living situation. However, my dedication to staying connected with the mycoNetwork and utilizing my full-stack development skills led me to embark on this journey.

The project aims to address the limitations of existing mycology forums, such as outdated features, lack of structured documentation, and limited user engagement. By leveraging my expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and TypeScript, I am building a comprehensive platform that incorporates the best elements of its predecessors while introducing new features and enhanced security measures.

## Features

- **Tek Management**: Users can document and manage various mycological techniques, fostering a centralized repository of knowledge.
- **Live Culture Library**: The platform enables users to track their live cultures, including growth stages and observations, facilitating a more organized approach to mycology.
- **Social Media Integration**: mycoTek includes a community space where users can follow each other, exchange information, and even trade or sell cultures and supplies, promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Inspiration and Vision

The inspiration for mycoTek's user interface stems from the fascinating patterns found in mycelium growth and the Linux directory tree structure. By implementing a unique scrolling tree UI component in React, I aim to create an intuitive and visually appealing navigation system that resonates with the mycology community.

Throughout my years of coding, I have often struggled to complete projects due to losing interest. However, mycoTek holds a special place in my heart, as it combines my passion for mycology with my technical skills. The project's meaningful nature and potential to make a positive impact on the mycology community have kept me motivated and committed to its success.

## Future Enhancements

As I near the completion of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), I am already planning for future enhancements to ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of mycoTek. One crucial upgrade involves improving the JWT (JSON Web Token) system by incorporating short-lived access tokens with a refresh system, replacing the single long-lasting JWT. This enhancement will further strengthen user privacy and data protection, aligning with my commitment to creating a secure platform for the mycology community.

## Getting Involved

I am excited to share mycoTek with the world and invite the mycology community to join me in shaping its future. Whether you are a seasoned mycologist, a curious beginner, or a tech enthusiast, your contributions and feedback are invaluable. Together, we can create a platform that not only serves as a repository of knowledge but also fosters a sense of belonging and collaboration within the mycology community.

Stay tuned for the official launch of mycoTek, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or simply want to connect over our shared love for mycology.

Happy growing!
