Mycotek UI/UX Concept Summary:
Core Concept:

Mycotek's interface is based on a clean, modern, and intuitive design, inspired by fractal geometry, where the user experience unfolds in an expanding, exploratory manner.
Initial User Interaction:

Upon login, users are greeted with a straightforward and uncluttered interface presenting three main options: "My Account", "Mycology", and "Store" (to be added post-MVP).
These options are visually represented as distinct boxes or elements, ensuring ease of navigation right from the start.
Expanding Interface:

Selecting an option (e.g., "Mycology") triggers that box to expand and fill the viewport, emulating the experience of maximizing a window in a computer application. This transition focuses the user's attention on their chosen path, minimizing distractions.
Within the expanded "Mycology" section, further categorized options such as "Cultures", "Teks", and "Forum" (to be added later) are presented, continuing the theme of clear, focused choices.
Fractal-Inspired Design:

The idea draws inspiration from AI-generated fractals, where deeper exploration reveals more layers and details. This design choice introduces an element of discovery and engagement in the user journey.
As users navigate deeper, they encounter more specific functionalities and information, tailored to their selections.
Focus on Completion:

The current focus is on achieving a minimum viable product (MVP) to ensure the core functionalities are in place and refined before expanding further into additional features like the "Store" and "Forum".
Next Steps:

Your immediate next steps involve translating this UI/UX concept into a functional design. This includes sketching layouts, deciding on visual elements like colors and typography, and starting the process of UI development with these expanding and contracting elements.
